## Introduction
How to create AKS cluster using Hashicorp Terraform as per the Wesco Standards. The AKS cluster in this guide supports the following features:

- AKS-managed Azure Active Directory integration
- Azure Monitor for Containers
- Automatic AKS version upgrades
- Separate node pools for user and system workloads
- A system assigned managed cluster identity
- Autoscaling node pools
- Availability Zone Configuration
- Azure Policy for Kubernetes

## Pre-requisites
- Azure Subscription
- Terraform Cloud Account

## Software Dependencies/Tools
- Terraform (IAC)
- Terraform Azure Provider plugin(Extension)
- Visual Studio Code Editor(Optional)
- Terraform Lint
- Terraform docs

## Steps
- Step1: Define an AKS Kubernetes cluster with Terraform as per the wesco standard
- Step2: Set up terraform cloud structure to store state files in Terraform Workspace
- Step3: Create the Kubernetes cluster
- Step4: Test the Kubernetes cluster
- Step5: Monitoring and logs

## Project structure
- **main**: deployment and modules folder contains the terraform scripts.

- **Deployment**: [deployment](deployment) folder contains details of multiple environments such as dev, prod and qa.

- **modules**: [modules](modules) represent here in this layout the Terraform modules (general re-used functions) . We have basically 4 modules:
	 - **acr**: AKS Container Registry service
	 - **aks_cluster**: the main unit providing the AKS service
	 - **aks_network**: Create the cluster Virtual Network and subnetwork on Azure
	 - **log_analytics**: Container Insights is the unit that manages logs and cluster health checks.
	 - **privatednszone**: access the cluster in private dns zones
	 - **privateendpoint**: private end

### Terraform module structure

- The module is a container for multiple resources that are used together.
	 - [ ] **main.t**f: the aks cluster resources are packaged in the main.tf file
	 - [ ] **variables.tf**: In Terraform, modules can have input parameters, too. To define them, you use a mechanism input variables.
	 - [ ] **output.tf**: In Terraform, a module can also return values. Again, this is done using a mechanism: output variables.
